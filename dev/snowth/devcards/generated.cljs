  "# Randomly generated satellites

  Now this is pretty cool. Thanks to the magic of `clojure.spec`, the code
  specification for a satellite in `snowth` can be used to randomly generate
  satellites that conform to itself. This can be used to test that the code for
  handling satellites doesn't break, and also to show you a bunch of cool
  analemmas for planets that don't necessarily exist.

  These analemmas will be unique for every page load, and I can't guarantee
  that each one will be displayed optimally, but they are usually pretty good.
  Enjoy!")
